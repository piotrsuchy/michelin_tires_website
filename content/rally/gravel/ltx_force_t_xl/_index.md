An extra-load version of the LTX Force T, built with reinforced sidewalls to withstand heavy impacts and aggressive driving on the roughest rally stages.
The MICHELIN LTX Force T XL reinforces the sidewalls thanks to the extra thickness of the rubber, making them more resistant to lateral aggression and punctures.
